            <b>What is being shown?</b><br/>
            This visualization shows a so-called cartogram, which is a map with an encoded variable distorting the geographical information in order to highlight said variable. In this specific cartogram, the variable that causes the geometric distortion is the area of a countries organic farming land.</br>
            <b>Is the visualization interactive or static?</b></br>
            This visualization is static.</br>
            <b>What are some of the design choices and visualization techniques used?</b></br>
            In this visualization, colors in the same range encode for a specific region. E.g. western Europe is represented by red and only slight differences in gradients are used to make countries discernable. The distortion clearly outlines that e.g. Australia has a large proportion on certified organic farming land when compared to other countries, such as the U.S..</br>
            <b>What, in your opinion, is the rationale behind the design choices? </b><br/>
            The choice to color code a certain region, such as Europe, within the same color range helps blending individual contries into bigger areas and help giving the user a view of the bigger picture and allows for cross contintent comparison.<br/>
            Since humans are very familiar with using maps, using a standard representation of the earth helps with connecting the information we want to showcase through the cartogram (in this case organic farming area) with their knowledge of geography.</br>
            <b>Do you think this is a good visualization? Give a short critique on why or why not.</b><br/>
            I think cartograms are a great way of focussing a user's attention on a very specific variable with concern to geographical data. Building upon the prior knowledge of maps, the distortion easily shows a specific variable.</br>
